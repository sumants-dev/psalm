# Document Store Spec

The document store defines where documents are kept. We use the documents to create context and sent to LLMs. Our anonymization still applies here at REST and interactions with AI.


## Vector Collection
* `vector_collection` is the document store that will be use for retrieval augment generation
    * `type` support only `pgvector`
    * `conn_str` put the postgres connection string
    * `collection_name` defines the table to be used, we recommend node

## Chunker
* `chunker` take in documents and chunk it in snippets that have context
    * `type` supports `simple`, `nltk`, and `spacy`
    * `chunk_overlap` is an integer that defines that allowed overlap words between each chunk

## Embedder
* `embedder` is a the transformer applied to chunks into document store
    * `type` only supports `sentence_transformer` from hugging face
    * `model` any from hugging face will work

## Example
```yaml copy
document_store:
  vector_collection:
    type: pgvector
    conn_str: <put-your-api-key-here>
    collection_name: node
  chunker:
    type: simple
    chunk_overlap: 10
  embedder:
    type: sentence_transformer
    model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
```
