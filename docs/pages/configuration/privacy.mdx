# Privacy Spec

Privacy is core to our orchestration. This spec define elements that can be configured that affect privacy. This top level component is used throughout all our flows.


## Anoymizer

* `type`- only supports presidio from microsoft. Our anoymizer are not deterministic so there is not a 1 to 1 mapping from PII to token, as GDPR implies that 1 to 1 token mapping is still PII.
* `key`- 16 character base 64 key
* `entity_resolution` - supports only `containment` or `equality`. Containment is that similair looking PII resolve to same entity. For example, Rushabh and Rushabh Mehta are the same entity. In contrast, `equality` implies that Rushabh and Rushabh Mehta are resolved differently
* `threshold`- set the sensitivity of anoymizer
* `pii_types`- we support the following [`person`, `email_address`, `phone_number`, `person`, `social`, `ip`, `card`, `bank`, `passport`, `ssn`]

## Example
```yaml copy
privacy:
  anoymizer:
    type: presidio
    # don't use this key in production, it's just for testing
    key: mcFsaV/gv20q7mUhmI3alg==
    threshold: .5
    entity_resolution: containment
    pii_types:
      - person
      - email_address
```
