# Deployment (WIP)

## Local Hosting

To use Pontus locally, it often easiest to use our docker image. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PontusAI/psalm.git
docker build -t pontus . 
docker run -p 8080:8080 pontus
```

This will start a local instance of Pontus on port 8080. You can then access the Pontus UI at http://localhost:8080.

## Cloud Providers

Pontus can be deployed to any cloud provider that supports Docker containers. We will be adding more detailed instructions for deploying to specific cloud providers in the future.
