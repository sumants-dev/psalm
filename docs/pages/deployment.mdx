# Deployment (WIP)

## Local Hosting

To use Pontus locally, it often easiest to use our docker image. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
docker pull pontus/pontus:latest
docker run -p 8080:8080 pontus/pontus:latest
```

This will start a local instance of Pontus on port 8080. You can then access the Pontus UI at http://localhost:8080.

## Cloud Providers

Pontus can be deployed to any cloud provider that supports Docker containers. We have provided a few examples below.
