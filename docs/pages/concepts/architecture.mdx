# Overview

Pontus exists as a thin layer between you and other AI services. Our typical deployment is as REST api microservice that sits between your application and the AI service. The service can be self-hosted or hosted by us.

We try to adhere to closely to endpoint and requests/response formats given by OpenAI and other AI services. This allows us to be a drop in replacement for your existing AI services.


Here is a high level diagram of the architecture:

This is not necessary to use Pontus. This is just for those who are curious.

Here is how a typical request flow follows. A service would make a call to Pontus. Pontus would process the request to santize PII, check for abuse, log the request, and then forward the request to the AI service. The AI service would then return a response to Pontus. Pontus would then process the response to re-add PII, check for abuse, log the response, and then return the response to the service.

It's easier to understand with a diagram:

Pontus handles all this, so you can focus on building your application. If you want to learn more, shoot us an email.
