AI can hallucinate or generate NSFW messages. This is a simple check to see if the text is safe for work. Currently, we only check for profanity in the text. We hope to expand beyond this in the future. We plan to use a NLP model to check for NSFW text. 

If you are interested in helping us expand this, please reach out to us at sumant@pontus.so
