Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. In this model, roles are defined for various job functions and permissions to access resources that are then tied to them.

Our AI layer will be able to automatically generate RBAC policies based on the data that is ingested into the system. This will allow us to automatically generate policies for groups based on allowed prompts and data that is ingested into the system.
