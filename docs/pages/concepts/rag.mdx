## Traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation

RAG is an AI framework for retrieving facts from an external knowledge base to ground large language models (LLMs) on the most accurate, up-to-date information and to give users insight into LLMs' generative process. However, traditional RAG often doesn't santize inputs and can often share sensitive information.

## Sanitized Retrieval Augmented Generation

Pontus's PSALM takes a step towards sanitizing RAG by sanitizing the inputs to the retrieval model. PSALM is a simple, yet effective, method for sanitizing inputs to the retrieval model by replacing sensitive data with a special token. This allows the retrieval model to still retrieve relevant facts, but not share sensitive information.
