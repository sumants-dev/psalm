Abstracting out your LLM API provider through pontus trust layer. Have a consistent way of interacting with LLMs, so that you can switch between providers without changing your code. We currently only support OpenAI as a provider, but we are working on adding more providers. Please create an issue on our github if you would like to see a specific provider added.
