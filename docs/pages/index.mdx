* **Secure RAG**: We add context and prevent hallucination through RAG without exposing unsantized document data.
* **Safety**: We prevent dangerous content from being sent to or from AI services.
* **Monitoring**: We provide monitoring and auditing of AI requests and responses.
* **Decoupling**: We decouple your application from AI services, allowing you to switch between AI services without changing your application.
* **Self Hosting**: We allow you to self host Pontus, giving you full control over your data.
