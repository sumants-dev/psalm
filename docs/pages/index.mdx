# Welcome to Pontus

Pontus makes building AI faster and more private. It uses a simple configuration file to define key elements like **Anonymization**, **Caching**, **Secure Rag**, and more. With this configuration, Pontus creates a microservice layer between your software and AI providers, ensuring privacy is embedded throughout your whole infrastructure.


<Callout type="warning">
    Pontus is currently in beta. We are actively working on improving the product and adding new features. If you have any feedback or feature requests, please let us by emailing us at <span> sumant@pontus.so </span>

## Why Pontus?
* **Open Source**: Extensibility and transparency are core to our mission.
* **Privacy**: We tokenize PII and prevent it from being sent to AI services.
* **No PII at Rest**: We do not store PII anywhere at REST.
* **Secure RAG**: We add context and prevent hallucination through RAG without exposing unsantized document data.
* **Safety**: We prevent dangerous content from being sent to or from AI services.
* **Monitoring**: We provide monitoring and auditing of AI requests and responses.
* **Decoupling**: We decouple your application from AI services, allowing you to switch between AI services without changing your application.
* **Self Hosting**: We allow you to self host Pontus, giving you full control over your data.
